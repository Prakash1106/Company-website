            <h1>Pie Charts</h1>
            <br />
            Pie chart concepts form the foundation of data visualization and are
            essential for analyzing a wide range of statistical problems.
            Understanding the fundamental concepts of pie charts is essential
            for students to excel in their placement examinations.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>Understanding the Concepts of Pie Charts</h3>
            A pie chart is a circular graph that visually represents data in
            proportions. They are divided into sectors or slices. A pie chart
            requires a list of categorical variables and numerical variables.
            Here, the term "pie" represents the whole, and the "slices"
            represent the parts of the whole.
            <br />
            The size of the sector shows the value of the data in terms of
            percentages, frequencies, or ratios. Since it's based on angles,
            it's highly useful in displaying proportions or data which add up to
            a whole. It allows us to know how much is the weightage of each part
            in the complete dataset.
            <br />
            This makes pie charts a preferable choice to determine percentages
            or fractions of something. For example, highlighting data about
            total sales, budget, demographic distribution, choices by people,
            etc.
            <br />
            To solve pie charts questions effectively, we are supposed to know a
            few concepts as most of the concepts around finding the sum,
            averages, percentages, and ratios.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>The following are the important pie charts concepts:</h3>
            <h3>1. Speed Maths</h3>
            Quicker calculation techniques are the key to solving any data
            interpretation question faster. A quick calculation can be mastered
            by working on 2 things:
            <br />
            <h4>1.1 Memory based</h4>
            There are a few things we need to know by heart to do the
            calculations faster, ex - Squares of numbers from 1 to 40, 20 x 20
            multiplication table, etc.
            <br />
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            Squares of numbers from 1 to 40, 20 x 20 multiplication table, cubes
            of numbers from 1-12, powers of numbers from 21 to 212, etc.
            <br />
            <h4>1.2 Calculation based Shortcuts</h4>
            Few speed math techniques can be learned to perform calculations
            faster.
            <br />
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            2 x 2 multiplication, finding squares of numbers, finding square
            roots quickly, etc.
            <br />
            <h3>2. Averages</h3>
            There are a few average-based questions asked in most of the pie
            chart sets, solve this effectively by adding the numbers and
            dividing them, and quick calculation of averages using approximation
            techniques will definitely help.
            <br />
            <h5>Special Clue:</h5> In most of the 'find the angle-based
            questions', the answer will be a multiple of 9.
            <br />
            <h3>3. Percentages</h3>
            There are specific percentage-based questions asked in most of the
            pie chart sets, like 'what percentage of A is B', 'A% of B,' or
            'percentage change'. To solve this effectively we need to be very
            good at calculating percentages.
            <br />
            <h3>4. Ratios</h3>
            Some of the questions from the pie chart question sets are based on
            ratios. These can be easily solved using approximation techniques,
            divisibility tests, and a basic foundational understanding of
            ratios. Percentage concepts will also be a great help in solving pie
            chart question sets.
