            <h1>Average</h1>
            <br />
            Average concepts are essential for students to properly solve a
            question. Our industry professionals have described the Average
            concepts in a detailed and understandable way.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>
              You can now understand the fundamental concepts of Average. Listed
              below are the different Average concepts:
            </h3>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>1. What is Average?</h3>
            <br />
            In mathematics, Average is defined as the mean value, which is equal
            to the ratio of the sum of all values in a set to the total number
            of values/units present in the set.
            <br />
            The data can be anything like age, money, runs, etc. Average has
            many applications in real-life.
            <br />
            Average = sum of elements / number of elements
            <br />
            <br />
            <h5>Example Problem</h5>
            <br />
            The Average of 3, 6, and 9 is 3 + 6 + 9 = 18÷ 3 = 6. So the Average
            is 6. It means 6 is the central value of 3, 6, and 9.
            <br />
            Therefore, Average means to find out the mean value of a group of
            numbers.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>2. How to Find the Average of the given numbers?</h3>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h5>Example Problem</h5>
            <br />
            The marks obtained by 8 students in a class test are 12, 15, 16, 18,
            20, 10, 11, and 21. Use the Average formula and find out what the
            Average of the marks obtained by the students is.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h5>Solution:</h5>
            <br />
            Marks obtained by 8 students in class test = 12, 15, 16, 18, 20, 10,
            11, and 21 (given)
            <br />
            Total marks obtained by 8 students in class test
            =(12+15+16+18+20+10+11+21) = 123/8
            <br />
            Using the Average formula,
            <br />
            Average = (Sum of Observation) ÷ (Total numbers of Observations)
            <br />
            Average = (12+15+16+18+20+10+11+21) ÷ 8
            <br />
            Average = 123/8
            <br />
            Average of marks obtained by 8 students = 15.375
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>3. Rules of Average</h3>
            <br />
            Here are some handy tricks for Average which will make your
            calculation faster and more efficient with practice:
            <br />
            (1) If the value of each number is increased by the same value 'a',
            then the Average of all numbers will also increase by 'a'.
            <br />
            (2) If the value of each number is decreased by the same value 'a',
            then the Average of all numbers will also decrease by 'a'.
            <br />
            (3) If the value of each number is multiplied by the same value 'a',
            then the Average of all numbers will also get multiplied by 'a'.
            <br />
            (4) If the value of each number is divided by the same value 'a',
            then the Average of all numbers will also get divided by 'a'.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>4. Average of two or more groups taken together</h3>
            <br />
            (a) If the number of quantities in two groups is n₁ and n₂ and their
            Average is x and Y, respectively, the combined Average (Average of
            all of them put together) is =(n₁ x+n₂ Y)/(n₁+n₂ )
            <br />
            (b) If the Average of ₁ quantities is x and the Average of n₂
            quantities out of them is Y, the average of the remaining group
            (rest of the quantities) is =(n₁ x-n₂ Y)/(n₁ – n₂ )
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>5. What is Average Speed?</h3>
            <br />
            Average Speed is the rate at which a journey takes place. Throughout
            a journey, the Speed is not constant; it varies from time to time.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h5>Average Speed Formula</h5>
            <br />
            The Average Speed of an object is equal to the total distance
            covered by the object, divided by the total time taken to cover the
            distance.
            <br />
            Average Speed = Total distance covered ÷ Total time taken.
            <br />
            S = D/T.
            <br />
            Where
            <br />
            'D' is the distance travelled in some time 'T'
            <br />
            'S' is the Speed of the object for this journey.
