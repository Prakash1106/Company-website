            <h1>Line Graph</h1>
            <br />
            Line graphs concepts form the foundation of data visualization and
            are essential for solving a wide range of data interpretation
            problems. Understanding the fundamental concepts of line graphs is
            essential for students to excel in their placement examinations.
            <br />
            <h3>Understanding the Concepts of Line Graphs</h3>
            <br />
            Line graphs provide a powerful tool for representing and analyzing
            data relationships over time. We plot the data point corresponding
            to the two variables on an XY cartesian plain.
            <br />
            Then, a straight line joins all the points plotted, revealing a
            pattern that shows the trend in data over a period of time. It is
            highly used in analyzing the performance of market, stocks, profits,
            losses, expenditures, and other business metrics.
            <br />
            To solve line graphs questions effectively, we are supposed to know
            a few concepts as most of the concepts around finding the sum,
            averages, percentages and ratios.
            <br />
            <h3>The following are the important line graphs concepts:</h3>
            <h3>1. Speed Maths</h3>
            Quicker calculation techniques are the key to solving any data
            interpretation question faster. A quick calculation can be mastered
            by working on 2 things:
            <br />
            <h4>1.1 Memory Based</h4>
            There are a few things we need to know by heart to do the
            calculations faster, ex - Squares of numbers from 1 to 40, 20 x 20
            multiplication table, etc.
            <br />
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            Squares of numbers from 1 to 40, 20 x 20 multiplication table, cubes
            of numbers from 1-12, powers of numbers from 21 to 212, etc.
            <br />
            <h4>1.2 Calculation Based Shortcuts</h4>
            Few speed math techniques can be learned to the calculations faster.
            <br />
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            2 x 2 multiplication, finding squares of numbers, finding square
            roots quickly, etc.
            <br />
            <h3>2. Averages</h3>
            There are few average based questions asked in most of the line
            graphs sets, solve this effectively by adding the numbers and
            dividing it and quick calculation of averages using approximation
            techniques will definitely help.
            <br />
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            If you're given a line graph showing sales of an article across 5
            months, how much was the average sale in the first 3 months?
            <br />
            Here, you can take the sum of the sales number in the 3 months in
            question and divide it by 3 to get the answer.
            <br />
            <h3>3. Percentages</h3>
            There are specific percentage based questions asked in most of the
            line graphs sets, like 'what percentage of A is B', 'A% of B,' or
            'percentage change'. To solve this effectively we need to be very
            good at calculation part of the percentages.
            <br />
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            If you're given a line graph showing sales of an article across 5
            months, how was the performance of sales in month 4 as compared to
            month 3?
            <br />
            Here, you can get the answer by finding out what percentage change
            in the sales of both the months.
            <br />
            <h3>4. Ratios</h3>
            Some of the questions from the line graphs question sets are based
            in ratios. These can be easily solved using approximation
            techniques, divisibility test and basic foundational understanding
            of ratios. Percentage concepts will also be a great help in solving
            line graph question sets.
            <br />
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            If you're given a line graph showing sales of an article across 5
            months, what is the ratio of the rise in sales in the first 2 months
            and last 2 months?
            <br />
            You can answer this question by finding the ratio of the percentage
            changes in sales for the first and last 2 months.
