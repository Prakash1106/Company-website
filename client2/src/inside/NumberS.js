            <h1>Number System</h1>
            Number system concepts form the foundation of mathematics and are
            essential for solving a wide range of mathematical problems.
            Understanding the fundamental concepts of number system is essential
            for students to excel in their placement examinations.

            <h2>Understanding the Concepts of Number System</h2>
            The number system is a fundamental concept in mathematics that deals
            with the representation and manipulation of numbers. It encompasses
            various number systems, such as the decimal system, binary system,
            octal system, and hexadecimal system. Understanding the concepts of
            the number system is essential for performing numerical operations,
            conversions, and solving problems.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h2>The following are the important number system concepts: </h2>
            <br />
            <h3>1. Number Bases</h3>
            <br /> Number bases refer to the positional notation systems used to
            represent numbers. The most commonly used base is the decimal system
            (base-10), but there are other bases like binary (base-2), octal
            (base-8), and hexadecimal (base-16). Each base has a set of digits
            and a positional value system. <br /> <br />
            <h3>2. Operations on Number Systems</h3>
            <br /> The number system allows for various operations, including
            addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These
            operations are performed based on the rules and properties of the
            specific number system being used.
            <br /> <br /> <h3>3. Decimal System</h3> <br /> The decimal system,
            also known as the base-10 system, is the most commonly used number
            system. It uses ten digits (0-9) to represent numbers. Each digit's
            position in a number carries a value based on powers of 10. For
            Example: The number 352 is interpreted as 3 × 10^2 + 5 × 10^1 + 2 ×
            10^0. <br /> <br />
            <h3>4. Binary System</h3>
            <br /> The binary system, also known as the base-2 system, is widely
            used in computer science and digital electronics. It uses two digits
            (0 and 1) to represent numbers. Each digit's position in a binary
            number carries a value based on powers of 2. For Example: The binary
            number 101 is interpreted as 1 × 2^2 + 0 × 2^1 + 1 × 2^0, which
            equals 5 in the decimal system. <br /> <br />
            <h3>5. Hexadecimal System</h3> <br /> The hexadecimal system, also
            known as the base-16 system, is commonly used in computer
            programming and digital representation. It uses sixteen digits (0-9
            and A-F) to represent numbers. The decimal numbers 10 to 15 are
            represented by the letters A to F, respectively. Each digit's
            position in a hexadecimal number carries a value based on powers of
            16. For Example: The hexadecimal number A3 is interpreted as 10 ×
            16^1 + 3 × 16^0, which equals 163 in the decimal system. <br />{" "}
            <br />
            <h3>6. Rational Numbers</h3>
            <br /> Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a
            fraction of two integers. They can be positive, negative, or zero.
            Rational numbers include integers, fractions, terminating decimals,
            and repeating decimals. For Example: 3/4, -5, 0.6, and 1.333... are
            all rational numbers. <br /> <br />
            <h3>7. Irrational Numbers</h3>
            <br /> Irrational numbers are numbers that cannot be expressed as a
            fraction of two integers. They are non-repeating and non-terminating
            decimals. For Example: Irrational numbers include π (pi) and √2
            (square root of 2). These numbers cannot be expressed exactly as a
            finite decimal or fraction. <br /> <br />
            <h3>8. Real Numbers</h3>
            <br /> Real numbers are the combination of rational and irrational
            numbers. They include all rational and irrational numbers. Real
            numbers can be represented on the number line and are used to
            measure quantities in various contexts, such as distance, time, and
            temperature.
