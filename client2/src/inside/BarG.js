            <h1>Bar Graph</h1>
            <br />
            Bar graphs concepts form the foundation of data visualization and
            are essential for solving a wide range of data interpretation
            problems. Understanding the fundamental concepts of bar graphs is
            essential for students to excel in their placement examinations
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>Understanding the Concepts of Bar Graphs</h3>
            <br />
            Bar graphs are particularly useful for displaying discrete data that
            can be divided into distinct categories. Bar graphs are essentially
            a visual representation of grouped data with considerable
            differences among the entries.
            <br />
            In a bar graph, the length or height of each bar corresponds to the
            value it represents. The bars are typically arranged horizontally or
            vertically along an axis, with the categories or groups being
            compared displayed on the other axis.
            <br />
            The value allows us to determine the relationship between the two
            categories and identify trends or draw conclusions based on the
            changes.
            <br />
            To solve bar graphs questions effectively, we are supposed to know a
            few concepts as most of the concepts around finding the sum,
            averages, percentages and ratios.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>The following are the important bar graphs concepts:</h3>
            <br />
            <h4>1. Speed Maths</h4>
            <br />
            Quicker calculation techniques are the key to solving any data
            interpretation question faster. A quick calculation can be mastered
            by working on 2 things:
            <br />
            <br />
            <h5>1.1 Memory Based</h5>
            There are a few things we need to know by heart to do the
            calculations faster, ex - Squares of numbers from 1 to 40, 20 x 20
            multiplication Table, etc.
            <br />
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            Squares of numbers from 1 to 40, 20 x 20 multiplication table, cubes
            of numbers from 1-12, powers of numbers from 21 to 212, etc.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h5>1.2 Calculation Based Shortcuts</h5>
            <br />
            Few speed math techniques can be learned to perform the calculations
            faster.
            <br />
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            <br />
            2 x 2 multiplication, finding squares of numbers, finding square
            roots quickly, etc.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>2. Averages</h4>
            There are few average based questions asked in most of the bar
            graphs sets, solve this effectively by adding the numbers and
            dividing it and quick calculation of averages using approximation
            techniques will definitely help.
            <br />
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            <br />
            If you're given a bar graph showing sales of an article across 5
            months, how much was the average sale in the first 3 months?
            <br />
            Here, you can take the sum of the sales number in the 3 months in
            question and divide it by 3 to get the answer.
            <br />
            <br />
            <h4>3. Percentages</h4>
            There are specific percentage based questions asked in most of the
            bar graphs sets, like 'what percentage of A is B', 'A% of B,' or
            'percentage change'. To solve this effectively we need to be very
            good at calculation part of the percentages.
            <br />
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            <br />
            If you're given a bar graph showing sales of an article across 5
            months, how was the performance of sales in month 4 as compared to
            month 3?
            <br />
            Here, you can get the answer by finding out what percentage change
            in the sales of both the months.
            <br />
            <h4>4. Ratios</h4>
            Some of the questions from the bar graphs question sets are based in
            ratios. These can be easily solved using approximation techniques,
            divisibility test and basic foundational understanding of ratios.
            Percentage concepts will also be a great help in solving bar graph
            question sets.
            <br />
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            <br />
            If you're given a bar graph showing sales of an article across 5
            months, what is the ratio of the rise in sales in the first 2 months
            and last 2 months?
            <br />
            You can answer this question by finding the ratio of the percentage
            changes in sales for the first and last 2 months.
            <br />
