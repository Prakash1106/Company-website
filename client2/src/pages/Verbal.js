            <h1>  BANKING AND CAPITAL MARKETS</h1>
            Banks and capital markets firms are facing unprecedented disruption. While reducing costs is critical, they must invest to meet customers’ digital expectations, manage risks, and attain sustainable business practices.
In the new normal, banks need to create customer-centric business models and provide relevant experiences and offers to meet the customers’ changing needs. We help our clients achieve those goals and drive customer-first growth. We work with 8 out of the top 15 banks, and 9 out of the top 15 diversified financial companies, to help them reimagine their business, become data-driven open enterprises, and better equip themselves to meet evolving demands from the market, partners, and regulators.

Capital market firms, meanwhile, need to reduce structural, operational, and per-unit trade costs, introduce efficiencies, and invest in digital infrastructure, while meeting increasing regulatory obligations. We help our clients create efficient and responsible organizations, with digital innovation at their core, including business, product and regional eco-systems. And our holistic data, cloud, and analytics solutions enhance customer engagement, streamline operations, and ensure more effective risk management.
