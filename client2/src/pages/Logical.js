            Capgemini has been selected by Airbus to participate in the deployment of ServiceNow in process management.
Using ServiceNow will extend the IT requests from ticketing and solving to business processes, from Engineering, to HR and Finance among others. This program will contribute to Airbusâ€™  digital transformation and offers more rapid, more simple and more efficient solutions to increase the operational performance. Our teams will closely work with the Airbus IT department to first define the use cases, then deploy and apply ServiceNow.

The contract covers Airbus commercial aircraft activities and will be delivered from France and India. Capgemini will onboard its entire value chain (infrastructures, test and quality, engineering, application services) and will be able to answer innovation stakes included in the agreement framework.
